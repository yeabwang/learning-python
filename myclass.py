Class
A class is a blueprint for creating objects. Objects are instances of classes and encapsulate data (attributes) and behavior (methods).

Constructor
A constructor in Python is a special method (__init__) used to initialize an objectâ€™s attributes when the object is created. It is automatically called when an object is instantiated.

Key Points:
The constructor method is named __init__.
It is optional. If not defined, Python provides a default constructor that does nothing.
Typically used to set up initial state (attributes) for the object.

Instance vs. Class Attributes
Instance attributes: Defined within the constructor using self (unique to each object).
Class attributes: Shared across all instances and defined outside the constructor.
