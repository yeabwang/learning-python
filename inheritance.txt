Inheritance in Python
Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows a class (child) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent). 

Key Concepts
Parent (Base/Super) Class: The class being inherited from.

Child (Derived/Sub) Class: The class that inherits the parent class.

Syntax:
class ParentClass:
    # Parent class body
    pass

class ChildClass(ParentClass):
    # Child class body
    pass
    
When we do this we are inheriting all the methods and parameters included in the parent class.

We mainly have four types of inheritances

1. Single Inheritance: Where one child will inherit from one parent class

2.
